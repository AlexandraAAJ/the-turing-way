# Challenges with Sustainability of Open Source projects

Early-career researchers often reach a point when funding has run out for a project that they have spent years developing, and they can face a daunting array of choices and obstacles on the road to turning an academic or community-led project into a strong, sustainable enterprise that will outlive its original funding source. In this chapter we will outline the factors that must be considered when you want to turn a project into a self-sustaining organisation, and we will provide several case studies as examples of how sustainability can be achieved through a variety of organisational structures.

## Misconceptions about Open Source models

To begin, we'd like to dispel the notion that "open source" simply means "free" and therefore an open source project can never generate revenue or profit. The [definition](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/open.html) used by The Turing Way states that open research should:
>Be publicly available: It is difficult to use and benefit from knowledge hidden behind barriers such as passwords and paywalls.
>

Although it is true that open research should be freely available, including in the monetary sense, this does not necessarily mean that a project that is run openly cannot be monetised. There are several pathways to generating revenue from an open source project, whether for profit or to sustain a non-profit enterprise. In this chapter we will examine several examples of organisations that are based entirely on open source technology and open research practices, and we will use these examples to describe a broad range of business practices under which open source communities can continue to thrive and grow while also supporting a self-sustaining enterprise. Narrowly-defined, a sustainable project must have funding to continue operations, which alone represents a daunting challenge to someone who wants to take their idea out of academia so that it can grow and thrive on its own. More broadly-defined, sustainable open source projects should encompass the values of reproducibility, transparency, accessibility, and reusability while maintaining an engaged and collaborative community of contributors. Many of the world's largest for-profit companies use and maintain open source software because open development has been shown to produce innovative, stable, and secure software tools that are in high demand around the world.
