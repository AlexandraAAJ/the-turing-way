# Challenges with sustainability of Open Source projects

Early-career researchers often reach a point when funding has run out for a project that they have spent years developing, and they can face a daunting array of choices and obstacles on the road to turning an academic or community-led project into a strong, sustainable enterprise that will outlive its original funding source. 
In this chapter we will outline the factors that must be considered when you want to turn a project into an Open Source Software (OSS) with a self-sustaining organisation, and we will explore how different projects have achieved sustainability through a variety of organisational structures.

## The big misconception about Open Source

One of the most common beliefs about Open Source is that it simply means "free" and therefore an open source project can never generate revenue or profit.
The [definition](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/open.html) used by The Turing Way states that OSS should:
>Be publicly available: It is difficult to use and benefit from knowledge hidden behind barriers such as passwords and paywalls.
>

Narrowly-defined, a sustainable project must have funding to continue operations, which alone represents a daunting challenge to someone who wants to take their idea out of academia so that it can grow and thrive on its own. 
More broadly-defined, sustainable open source projects encompass the values of reproducibility, transparency, accessibility, and reusability while maintaining an engaged and collaborative community of contributors - and this can be done through both monetised and non-monetised routes.
Although it is true that OSS should be freely available, including in the monetary sense, this does not necessarily mean that a project that is run openly and sustainably cannot be monetised. 

For instance, many of the world's largest companies build, use and maintain open source software because open development has been shown to produce innovative, stable, and secure software tools that are in high demand around the world. (citation: https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/state-of-enterprise-open-source-report-2022)

For a researcher at the end of an academic project, it can seem like there is a binary choice between commercialisation (for example, a startup or spinout company based on the research done in academia) and remaining open-source (for example, setting up a volunteer-based community governance model (citation: https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/guide-to-open-source-project-governance-models-overview) ). 
However, these two paths should not be considered mutually exclusive, and an open-source, community-governed project can work in tandem with a business based on that same project. 
There are several pathways to generating revenue from an open source project, whether for profit or to sustain a not-for-profit enterprise. 
In this chapter we'll present some of key considerations when looking to make a project sustainable, and how these differ depending on the organisational structure you want to pursue.

## Four pillars of OSS sustainability
The resulting project and any related enterprise will look different in each case, we've identified four key ingredients that we think all projects aiming for sustainability should consider:

- **Research & Innovation**: Is the project contributing to wider societal progress and continuing to improve?
- **Community Engagement**: Does the project have an active contributor base to carry the project forward?
- **Infrastructure & Maintenance**: Will the project be able to sustain itself and adapt to technological changes?
- **Support**: Can the project respond to the needs of its user communities?
